Math Fact Workout Project

This project lets student practice addition and subtraction in a visual "touch to answer" format.  It breaks math facts into
16 total categories and will show kids how well they did in each. 

My favorite (and newest) feature is the "Rewards" table that lets parents create and track prizes that they can award their 
kids for earning points in the game. 

This is my first time working with CoreData so I'm open to critique on where I've implemented save/fetch attempts.
